# geodesic-meshes
3D Geodesic Meshes of the Heart. The project was focused on optimizing 3D surface meshes of heart valves, to study their deformations in pathologies such as mitral valve prolapse (~3% of the population). We got in close collaboration with Wei Chen, whose expertise was crucial to successfully generate the desired geodesic quadrilateral meshes.
